## About Me

I am currently a PhD student from the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/?repeat=w3tc) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently advised by [Dr. Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com). 

Before I join this PhD program, I earned my dual Master's degree in both Computer Science (May 2023) and Educational Psychology (Dec 2023) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was gratefully supervised by [Dr. Edward Hubbard](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/hubbard-edward/), the director of the [Educational Neuroscience Laboratory](https://web.education.wisc.edu/edneurolab/) in the Department of Educational Psychology. In addition, I earned my Bachaler's degree from the Department of Psychology (May 2019) at National Taiwan University. 

My research centers on Human-AI Interaction (HAI) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). My goal is to understand, design, and develop interactive systems to enahnce human learning.
